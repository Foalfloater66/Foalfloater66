# Gruezi!
My name is Morgane, and I'm currently pursuing an MEng degree in Computer Science at University College London. Although most of my days consist of furious typing, I also enjoy implementing full-stack applications and bizarre algorithms!

I find repetitive mathematical patterns and cell division so beautiful. Cancer, not so much.
