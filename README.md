Did you know that the Internet Protocol is so expansive that it can even be run over Avian Carriers?

<i>An Avian Carrier as described in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1149">RFC 1149</a>.</i> </p>

> "Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking
   order.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and
   eradication.  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss
   of a carrier can be tolerated.  With time, the carriers are self-regenerating.  While broadcasting is not specified, storms can cause
   data loss.  There is persistent delivery retry, until the carrier
   drops.  Audit trails are automatically generated, and can often be
   found on logs and cable trays."
